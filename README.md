# CPT
Cross-protein transfer learning for variant effect prediction

This repository contains the variant effect preditions of CPT-1 for 18,602 human proteins. The proteins are split into two sets.

`transter_proteome_eve`: proteins in the EVE set ([Frazer et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04043-8))

`transfer_proteome_xgimpute`: proteins that do no have EVE results. The EVE-related features are cross-gene imputed.
